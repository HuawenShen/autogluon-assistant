I'll create a minimal bash script to execute the Python script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Create directory structure if it doesn't exist
mkdir -p dncakl/generation_iter_0

# Execute the Python script
python dncakl/generation_iter_0/generated_code.py

echo "Script execution completed"
```

This script simply ensures the directory structure exists and then runs the Python script at the specified path. Since the environment is already configured, no package installation is needed.
