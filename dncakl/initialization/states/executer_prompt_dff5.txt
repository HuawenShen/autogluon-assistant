I'll analyze the execution results and determine if any issues need to be fixed.

DECISION: FIX
ERROR_SUMMARY: The execution failed with error: "'>' not supported between instances of 'NoneType' and 'int'". This suggests that in the chardet.detect() function call, something is returning None which is then being compared with an integer. The encoding detection is failing and we need to handle the case when the encoding is None.
