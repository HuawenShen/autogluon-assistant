Your code should:
1. Import all modules used (e.g. import os).
1. Use appropriate libraries based on file type (pandas for tabular data, etc.)
2. For tabular files (csv, excel, parquet, etc.):
    - Display column names. If there are more than 20 columns, only display the first and last 10.
    - Show first 2-3 rows with truncated cell content (50 chars).
    - Do not show additional index column if it's not in the original table
    - If failed to open the file, treat it as text file
3. For text files:
    - Display first few lines (up to 1024 characters)
4. For compressed tabular or text files, show its decompressed content as described.
5. For binary or other files, provide only the most basic information.
6. Keep the total output under 1024 characters

Return ONLY the Python code, no explanations. The code should be self-contained and executable on its own.
