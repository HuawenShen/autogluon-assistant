I've analyzed the execution results of the Python code.

DECISION: FIX
ERROR_SUMMARY: The code failed with a TypeError: "'>' not supported between instances of 'NoneType' and 'int'" which likely occurs in the comparison of column numbers. There may be an issue with the file path or the file itself is empty/corrupted.

The error suggests that when trying to compare the number of columns with 20 (`if num_cols > 20`), `num_cols` is `None` rather than an integer. This indicates the DataFrame might be empty or not properly loaded. We need to fix the code to handle this scenario better and ensure the file path is correct.
