### Available ML Libraries:
Library Name: autogluon.timeseries
Version: v1.2.0
Description: AutoGluon Timeseries is an open-source AutoML framework that automates the training and tuning of forecasting models for time series data, handling tasks from preprocessing to model ensembling with built-in support for both univariate and multivariate forecasting.
Key Features & Limitations:
- timeseries forecasting


Library Name: autogluon.multimodal
Version: v1.2.0
Description: AutoGluon Multimodal is an open-source AutoML framework that simplifies the training of models across multiple data types including text, images, and tabular data, automating tasks from preprocessing to model ensembling with minimal code required.
Key Features & Limitations:
- Support multimodal classification or regression, document classification, semantic segmentation
- Does not work the best with pure tabular data (categorical and numerical).
- Does not support any generation tasks like image-to-image or sequence-to-sequence.


Library Name: autogluon.tabular
Version: v1.2.0
Description: AutoGluon Tabular is an open-source AutoML framework that automates the training and tuning of machine learning models for tabular data, handling tasks from preprocessing to model ensembling with minimal code required.
Key Features & Limitations:
- Works best when there are only tabular data (categorical and numerical).
- Does not work very well on nlp tasks.
- Does not work with image data.


Library Name: FlagEmbedding
Version: v1.3.4
Description: Retrieval and Retrieval-augmented LLMs
Key Features & Limitations:
- retrieval
- reranking


Library Name: machine learning or deep learning
Version: v0.1.0
Description: You should select this as a general reference of machine learning or deep learning algorithms in case other tools are not helpful.
