As an AutoML Agent, you will be given a folder containing data and description files. Please generate Python code using {tool_name} to train a predictor and make predictions on test data. Follow these specifications:

ONLY save files to the working directory: {output_folder}.

1. Data preprocessing:
   - Remove training data samples without valid labels (drop NA values from training dataset ONLY, NOT from test dataset) unless explicitly instructed otherwise.
   - Remove the unneccesary index column (if applicable)

2. Model training:
   - Use {tool_name} with appropriate parameters for the task
   - If a model is trained, save it in a folder with random timestamp within {output_folder}

3. Prediction:
   - Make predictions on the test data
   - Save the predicted results to {output_folder}, result file name should be "results", the format and extension should be same as the test data file
   - Output column names must exactly match those in the training or sample submission files without adding "predicted_" prefixes or creating any new columns.

4. Documentation:
   - Add a brief docstring at the beginning of the script explaining its purpose and usage
   - Also include additional installation steps with comments at the beginning of the script
   - Include comments explaining any complex operations or design decisions

5. Others:
   - To avoid DDP errors, wrap the code in: if __name__ == "__main__":
   - Ensure errors are propagated up and not silently caught - do not use try/except blocks unless you explicitly re-raise the exception.

Please provide the complete Python script that accomplishes these tasks, ensuring it's ready to run given the appropriate data inputs.
