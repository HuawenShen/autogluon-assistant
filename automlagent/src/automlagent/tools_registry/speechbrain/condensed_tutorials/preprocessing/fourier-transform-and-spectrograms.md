Summary: This tutorial provides implementation details for audio signal processing using Fourier transforms in Python/PyTorch. It covers three main techniques: basic Fourier Transform (FFT), Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT), and spectrogram computation. The tutorial helps with tasks like audio signal analysis, time-frequency representation, and signal reconstruction. Key features include efficient FFT implementation (O(NlogN)), windowing techniques, STFT parameter optimization, spectrogram visualization, and handling critical parameters like sample rate and window length. It emphasizes best practices for window selection, overlap settings, and visualization techniques, particularly useful for speech processing applications.

*This is a condensed version that preserves essential implementation details and context.*

Here's the condensed tutorial focusing on key implementation details and concepts:

# Fourier Transforms and Spectrograms Tutorial

## Key Concepts

1. **Fourier Transform (FT)**: Transforms time-domain signals into frequency domain
2. **Short-Term Fourier Transform (STFT)**: Provides time-frequency representation
3. **Spectrogram**: Magnitude representation of STFT

## 1. Fourier Transform Implementation

### Core Concepts
- Represents signal as weighted sum of complex sinusoids
- Maps real-valued sequences to complex-valued ones
- Uses Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm for efficiency (O(NlogN))

### Basic Implementation
```python
import torch
from speechbrain.dataio.dataio import read_audio

# Load and compute FFT
signal = read_audio('audio.wav')
fft = torch.fft.fft(signal.squeeze(), dim=0)

# Compute magnitude and phase
mag = torch.sqrt(torch.pow(fft.real, 2) + torch.pow(fft.imag, 2))
phase = torch.arctan(fft.imag/fft.real)
```

**Important**: Only plot magnitude from 0 to Nyquist frequency (fs/2) due to symmetry.

## 2. Short-Term Fourier Transform (STFT)

### Implementation Steps
1. Split signal into overlapped chunks
2. Apply windowing
3. Compute FFT for each chunk
4. Combine results

```python
from speechbrain.processing.features import STFT, ISTFT

# STFT computation
compute_STFT = STFT(
    sample_rate=16000,
    win_length=25,  # 25ms window
    hop_length=10,  # 10ms hop
    n_fft=400
)
signal_STFT = compute_STFT(signal)

# Inverse STFT
compute_ISTFT = ISTFT(
    sample_rate=16000,
    win_length=25,
    hop_length=10
)
signal_rec = compute_ISTFT(signal_STFT)
```

## 3. Spectrogram

### Implementation
```python
# Compute power spectrogram
spectrogram = signal_STFT.pow(2).sum(-1)
spectrogram = spectrogram.squeeze(0).transpose(0,1)
spectrogram_log = torch.log(spectrogram)  # for visualization

# Visualization
plt.imshow(spectrogram_log, cmap='hot', 
           interpolation='nearest', origin='lower')
plt.xlabel('Time')
plt.ylabel('Frequency')
```

### Important Considerations
- Window length affects time-frequency resolution trade-off:
  - Longer windows → better frequency resolution
  - Shorter windows → better time resolution
- Spectrogram is not invertible (phase information lost)
- Most speech energy concentrated in lower frequencies

## Best Practices
1. Use appropriate window lengths based on analysis needs
2. Consider overlapping windows for better reconstruction
3. Apply log transformation for better visualization
4. Remember Nyquist frequency when analyzing frequency content

## Critical Parameters
- `sample_rate`: Typically 16000 Hz for speech
- `win_length`: Window duration (ms)
- `hop_length`: Frame shift (ms)
- `n_fft`: Number of FFT points
