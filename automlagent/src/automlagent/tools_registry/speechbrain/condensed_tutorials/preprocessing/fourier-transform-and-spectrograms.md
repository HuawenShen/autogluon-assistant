Summary: This tutorial provides implementation guidance for audio signal processing using Fourier transforms in PyTorch, specifically covering DFT/FFT, Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT), and spectrogram computation. It demonstrates how to transform audio signals between time and frequency domains, with code examples for FFT calculation, STFT parameter configuration, and spectrogram generation. Key functionalities include signal reconstruction, power spectrogram computation, and handling of window parameters. The tutorial is particularly useful for tasks involving audio feature extraction, speech processing, and spectral analysis, emphasizing important considerations like time-frequency resolution tradeoffs and best practices for window length selection.

*This is a condensed version that preserves essential implementation details and context.*

Here's the condensed tutorial focusing on key implementation details and concepts:

# Fourier Transforms and Spectrograms - Implementation Guide

## 1. Fourier Transform (DFT/FFT)

### Key Concepts
- Transforms time-domain signal into frequency domain representation
- Represents signal as weighted sum of complex sinusoids
- FFT algorithm computes with O(NlogN) complexity vs O(N²) for DFT

### Implementation

```python
import torch
from speechbrain.dataio.dataio import read_audio

# Load audio
signal = read_audio('audio.wav')

# Compute FFT
fft = torch.fft.fft(signal.squeeze(), dim=0)

# Get magnitude and phase
mag = torch.sqrt(torch.pow(fft.real, 2) + torch.pow(fft.imag, 2))
phase = torch.arctan(fft.imag/fft.real)

# Reconstruct signal
signal_rec = torch.fft.ifft(fft, dim=0)
```

**Important Notes:**
- FFT output is symmetric - only need to analyze up to Nyquist frequency (fs/2)
- Phase information is typically noisy and harder to interpret
- Speech energy concentrates in lower frequencies

## 2. Short-Term Fourier Transform (STFT)

### Implementation
```python
from speechbrain.processing.features import STFT, ISTFT

# Configure STFT
compute_STFT = STFT(
    sample_rate=16000,
    win_length=25,  # 25ms window
    hop_length=10,  # 10ms hop
    n_fft=400
)

# Compute STFT
signal_STFT = compute_STFT(signal.unsqueeze(0))  # [batch, time, freq, real/imag]

# Inverse STFT
compute_ISTFT = ISTFT(sample_rate=16000, win_length=25, hop_length=10)
signal_rec = compute_ISTFT(signal_STFT)
```

**Key Parameters:**
- `win_length`: Window size in milliseconds
- `hop_length`: Window shift in milliseconds
- `n_fft`: Number of FFT points

## 3. Spectrogram

### Implementation
```python
# Compute power spectrogram
spectrogram = signal_STFT.pow(2).sum(-1)  # Sum real/imag components
spectrogram = spectrogram.squeeze(0).transpose(0,1)
spectrogram_log = torch.log(spectrogram)  # Log scale for visualization
```

**Important Considerations:**
- Time-frequency resolution tradeoff:
  - Longer windows → better frequency resolution, worse time resolution
  - Shorter windows → better time resolution, worse frequency resolution
- Spectrogram is not invertible (phase information lost)
- Common starting point for FBANK and MFCC features

### Best Practices
1. Choose window length based on analysis needs:
   - Speech analysis: 20-30ms typical
   - Transient analysis: shorter windows
2. Use log scale for visualization
3. Consider overlapping windows for smoother analysis
4. Select appropriate FFT size for desired frequency resolution
