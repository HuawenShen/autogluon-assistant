Summary: This tutorial provides implementation guidance for speech feature extraction in Python using SpeechBrain, focusing on three main techniques: Filter Banks (FBANKs), MFCCs, and context information processing. It demonstrates how to compute these features with specific code examples and parameter configurations, particularly useful for speech recognition and audio processing tasks. Key functionalities covered include STFT computation, mel filterbank application, MFCC extraction, derivative calculations, and context window implementation. The tutorial emphasizes modern deep learning best practices, suggesting the use of FBANKs over MFCCs and explaining how to configure feature dimensions for different approaches (standard MFCCs: 13 coefficients, with derivatives: 39 dimensions, with context windows: variable size).

*This is a condensed version that preserves essential implementation details and context.*

Here's the condensed tutorial focusing on key implementation details and concepts:

# Speech Features Tutorial

## Key Concepts
- Speech is high-dimensional (16000 samples/second at 16kHz)
- Feature extraction creates compact representations
- Modern approach: Use simple features and let neural networks learn higher-level representations

## 1. Filter Banks (FBANKs)

### Implementation

```python
from speechbrain.processing.features import STFT, spectral_magnitude, Filterbank
from speechbrain.lobes.features import Fbank

# Basic FBANK computation
compute_STFT = STFT(sample_rate=16000, win_length=25, hop_length=10, n_fft=400)
compute_fbanks = Filterbank(n_mels=40)

# Pipeline:
STFT = compute_STFT(signal)
mag = spectral_magnitude(STFT)
fbanks = compute_fbanks(mag)

# Simplified usage with Fbank lobe
fbank_maker = Fbank()
fbanks = fbank_maker(signal)
```

**Important Parameters:**
- n_mels: Number of mel filters (typically 40 or 80)
- freeze: When False, filters can be tuned during training

## 2. MFCCs (Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients)

```python
from speechbrain.lobes.features import MFCC

mfcc_maker = MFCC(n_mfcc=13, deltas=False, context=False)
mfccs = mfcc_maker(signal)
```

**Note:** While historically important for decorrelated features, FBANKs are now preferred with deep learning approaches.

## 3. Context Information

### Derivatives Implementation
```python
mfcc_maker = MFCC(
    n_mfcc=13,
    deltas=True,  # Enables derivatives
    context=False
)
```

### Context Windows Implementation
```python
mfcc_maker = MFCC(
    n_mfcc=13,
    deltas=True,
    context=True,
    left_frames=5,
    right_frames=5
)
```

**Key Parameters:**
- deltas: Enables first and second-order derivatives
- left_frames/right_frames: Number of context frames to include

## Best Practices
1. For modern deep learning:
   - Use FBANKs over MFCCs
   - Consider using spectrograms or raw STFT directly
   - Let CNNs learn context through their receptive field

2. Feature dimensions:
   - Standard MFCCs: 13 coefficients
   - With derivatives: 39 dimensions (13 static + 13 delta + 13 delta-delta)
   - With context windows: Depends on window size (e.g., 429 for 11 frames with derivatives)

3. Modern trends:
   - Raw waveform processing becoming more common
   - SincNet for direct time-domain learning
   - CNN-based context learning preferred over hand-crafted context
