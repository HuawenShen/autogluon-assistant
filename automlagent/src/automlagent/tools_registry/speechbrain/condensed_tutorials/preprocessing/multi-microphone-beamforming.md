Summary: This tutorial provides implementation guidance for multi-microphone beamforming techniques in audio processing. It covers three main beamforming methods: Delay-and-Sum, MVDR (Minimum Variance Distortionless Response), and GEV (Generalized Eigenvalue) beamforming, along with DOA (Direction of Arrival) estimation using SRP-PHAT and MUSIC algorithms. The tutorial helps with tasks like speech enhancement, noise reduction, and sound source localization. Key features include signal propagation modeling, covariance matrix estimation, STFT-based frequency domain processing, and practical implementations using the SpeechBrain toolkit. It provides code examples for handling different noise scenarios (diffuse and directive) and includes essential mathematical formulations for each technique.

*This is a condensed version that preserves essential implementation details and context.*

Here's the condensed tutorial focusing on key implementation details and concepts:

# Multi-microphone Beamforming - Essential Implementation Guide

## Core Concepts

### Signal Propagation Model
```
x_m[n] = h_m[n] * s[n] + b_m[n]
```
Where:
- m: microphone index
- n: sample index
- h_m: room impulse response
- s[n]: speech source signal
- b_m[n]: additive noise
- x_m[n]: captured signal at microphone m

Frequency domain representation:
```
X_m(t,jω) = H_m(jω)S(t,jω) + B_m(t,jω)
```

### Key Covariance Matrices
```python
# Speech covariance matrix estimation using time-frequency mask
R_SS(jω) ≈ (1/T)∑[M_S(t,jω)X(t,jω)X^H(t,jω)]

# Noise covariance matrix estimation
R_NN(jω) ≈ (1/T)∑[M_N(t,jω)X(t,jω)X^H(t,jω)]
```

## Direction of Arrival (DOA) Methods

### 1. SRP-PHAT
- Scans potential directions on unit sphere
- Computes power for each direction
- Selects maximum power direction as DOA
```python
u_max = argmax_u{E(u)}
```

### 2. MUSIC Algorithm
- Uses eigendecomposition of covariance matrix
- Scans potential directions
- Power calculation:
```python
E(u) = A^H(jω,u)A(jω,u) / sqrt(A^H(jω,u)U(jω)U^H(jω)A(jω,u))
```

## Beamforming Techniques

### 1. Delay and Sum
```python
W(jω) = (1/M)A(jω)
```

### 2. MVDR
```python
W(jω) = R_XX^(-1)(jω)A(jω) / (A^H(jω)R_XX^(-1)(jω)A(jω))
```

### 3. GEV
- Based on generalized eigenvalue decomposition
```python
R_SS(jω)W(jω) = λR_NN(jω)W(jω)
```

## Important Notes
- All beamforming is applied in frequency domain: Y(jω) = W^H(jω)X(jω)
- Time-frequency masks are commonly used for practical covariance matrix estimation
- TDOA estimation typically uses GCC-PHAT method

## Setup
```python
# Install SpeechBrain
!python -m pip install git+https://github.com/speechbrain/speechbrain.git@develop
```

Here's the condensed tutorial focusing on key implementation details and concepts:

# Audio Preparation and Beamforming Implementation

## Audio Setup and Preprocessing

```python
# Load audio samples
xs_speech = read_audio('speech_-0.82918_0.55279_-0.082918.flac').unsqueeze(0)
xs_noise_diff = read_audio('noise_diffuse.flac').unsqueeze(0)
xs_noise_loc = read_audio('noise_0.70225_-0.70225_0.11704.flac').unsqueeze(0)
fs = 16000  # sampling rate

# Create noisy mixtures
ss = xs_speech
nn_diff = 0.05 * xs_noise_diff
nn_loc = 0.05 * xs_noise_loc
xs_diffused_noise = ss + nn_diff
xs_localized_noise = ss + nn_loc
```

## Key Beamforming Implementations

### 1. SRP-PHAT (Steered-Response Power with Phase Transform)

```python
# Define microphone array geometry
mics = torch.zeros((4,3), dtype=torch.float)
mics[0,:] = torch.FloatTensor([-0.05, -0.05, +0.00])
mics[1,:] = torch.FloatTensor([-0.05, +0.05, +0.00])
mics[2,:] = torch.FloatTensor([+0.05, +0.05, +0.00])
mics[3,:] = torch.FloatTensor([+0.05, +0.05, +0.00])

# Process pipeline
stft = STFT(sample_rate=fs)
cov = Covariance()
srpphat = SrpPhat(mics=mics)

Xs = stft(xs_diffused_noise)
XXs = cov(Xs)
doas = srpphat(XXs)
```

### 2. MUSIC (Multiple Signal Classification)

```python
music = Music(mics=mics)
doas = music(XXs)  # Using same STFT and covariance as SRP-PHAT
```

### 3. Delay-and-Sum Beamforming

```python
stft = STFT(sample_rate=fs)
cov = Covariance()
gccphat = GccPhat()
delaysum = DelaySum()
istft = ISTFT(sample_rate=fs)

# Processing pipeline
Xs = stft(xs_diffused_noise)
XXs = cov(Xs)
tdoas = gccphat(XXs)
Ys_ds = delaysum(Xs, tdoas)
ys_ds = istft(Ys_ds)
```

## Important Notes:

1. **Microphone Array Configuration**:
   - Circular array with 4 microphones
   - Diameter: 0.1m
   - Uniform spacing
   - All microphones lie on xy-plane

2. **Limitations**:
   - Cannot distinguish between positive and negative z-axis due to planar array configuration
   - Slight direction inaccuracies due to sphere discretization

3. **Signal Processing Flow**:
   1. STFT conversion to frequency domain
   2. Covariance matrix computation per frequency bin
   3. DOA estimation or beamforming
   4. ISTFT for time-domain conversion (in Delay-and-Sum)

4. **Input Signal Types**:
   - Clean speech
   - Diffuse noise (omnidirectional)
   - Directive noise (point source)
   - Mixing ratio: 0.05 for noise signals

This implementation provides methods for both DOA estimation (SRP-PHAT, MUSIC) and speech enhancement (Delay-and-Sum beamforming) in multichannel audio processing.

Here's the condensed tutorial focusing on key implementation details and techniques:

# Multi-Channel Speech Processing Implementation Guide

## Key Beamforming Techniques

### 1. Delay-and-Sum Beamforming with Directive Noise

```python
# Core components
stft = STFT(sample_rate=fs)
cov = Covariance()
gccphat = GccPhat()
delaysum = DelaySum()
istft = ISTFT(sample_rate=fs)

# Implementation flow
Xs = stft(xs_diffused_noise)  # Convert to frequency domain
XXs = cov(Xs)                 # Compute covariance matrix
tdoas = gccphat(XXs)         # Estimate TDOAs
Ys_ds = delaysum(Xs, tdoas)  # Apply beamforming
ys_ds = istft(Ys_ds)         # Convert back to time domain
```

**Important Note**: With directive noise, GCC-PHAT may capture TDOAs from noise sources. Consider using ideal binary masks to differentiate speech TDOAs from noise TDOAs.

### 2. Minimum Variance Distortionless Response (MVDR)

```python
# Additional component
mvdr = Mvdr()

# For diffuse noise
Xs = stft(xs_diffused_noise)
Nn = stft(nn_diff)
NNs = cov(Nn)                # Noise covariance
XXs = cov(Xs)
tdoas = gccphat(XXs)
Ys_mvdr = mvdr(Xs, NNs, tdoas)
ys_mvdr = istft(Ys_mvdr)
```

### 3. Generalized Eigenvalue Beamforming (GEV)

```python
# Setup
gev = Gev()

# Implementation
Xs = stft(xs_diffused_noise)
Ss = stft(ss)                # Clean speech
Nn = stft(nn_diff)          # Noise
SSs = cov(Ss)               # Speech covariance
NNs = cov(Nn)               # Noise covariance
Ys_gev = gev(Xs, SSs, NNs)
ys_gev = istft(Ys_gev)
```

## Key Technical Points

1. All methods require STFT for frequency domain conversion
2. Covariance matrices are computed per frequency bin
3. GCC-PHAT estimates Time Difference of Arrival (TDOA) between microphones
4. MVDR and GEV require noise covariance estimation
5. GEV additionally needs speech covariance estimation

## Best Practices

- Consider using ideal binary masks for directive noise scenarios
- Validate TDOA estimates when dealing with multiple sound sources
- Monitor covariance matrix quality for optimal beamforming performance
- Choose appropriate beamforming method based on noise characteristics:
  - Delay-and-Sum: Simple scenarios
  - MVDR: Known noise conditions
  - GEV: When both speech and noise statistics are available
