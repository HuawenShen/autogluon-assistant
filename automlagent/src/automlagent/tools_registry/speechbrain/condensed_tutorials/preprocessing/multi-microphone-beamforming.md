Summary: This tutorial provides implementation details for multi-microphone beamforming using SpeechBrain, covering three main beamforming techniques: SRP-PHAT, MUSIC, and Delay-and-Sum. It demonstrates how to implement signal processing pipelines for audio processing, direction of arrival (DOA) estimation, and beamforming in the frequency domain. Key functionalities include covariance matrix estimation, time difference of arrival calculations using GCC-PHAT, and various beamforming methods (Delay-Sum, MVDR, GEV). The tutorial helps with tasks like noise reduction, speech enhancement, and source localization, providing practical code examples for microphone array setup, STFT processing, and implementing different beamforming algorithms with specific considerations for both diffuse and directive noise scenarios.

# Multi-microphone Beamforming - Key Implementation Details

## Core Concepts

### Propagation Model
- Time domain: `x_m[n] = h_m[n] * s[n] + b_m[n]`
- Frequency domain: `X_m(t,jω) = H_m(jω)S(t,jω) + B_m(t,jω)`
- Vector form: `X(t,jω) = H(jω)S(t,jω) + B(t,jω)`

### Critical Formulas

1. **Covariance Matrices**:
```
R_XX(jω) = (1/T)∑[X(t,jω)X^H(t,jω)]
R_SS(jω) ≈ (1/T)∑[M_S(t,jω)X(t,jω)X^H(t,jω)]
R_NN(jω) ≈ (1/T)∑[M_N(t,jω)X(t,jω)X^H(t,jω)]
```

2. **Time Difference of Arrival (GCC-PHAT)**:
```
τ_m = argmax_τ ∫[X_1(jω)X_m(jω)*/|X_1(jω)||X_m(jω)|]e^(jωτ)dω
```

## Direction of Arrival (DOA) Methods

### SRP-PHAT
- Scans potential directions on unit sphere
- Power calculation:
```
E(u) = ∑∑∫[X_p(jω)X_q(jω)*/|X_p(jω)||X_q(jω)|]A_p(jω,u)A_q(jω,u)*dω
```

### MUSIC Algorithm
- Power calculation:
```
E(u) = A(jω,u)^H A(jω,u) / sqrt(A(jω,u)^H U(jω)U(jω)^H A(jω,u))
```

## Beamforming Techniques

### Implementation in Frequency Domain
```python
Y(jω) = W^H(jω)X(jω)
```

### Key Methods:

1. **Delay and Sum**
```
W(jω) = (1/M)A(jω)
```

2. **MVDR**
```
W(jω) = R_XX^(-1)(jω)A(jω) / [A^H(jω)R_XX^(-1)(jω)A(jω)]
```

3. **GEV**
```
R_SS(jω)W(jω) = λR_NN(jω)W(jω)
```

## Best Practices
- Use time-frequency masks for covariance matrix estimation
- Consider array geometry for DOA estimation
- Select appropriate beamforming technique based on acoustic conditions

## Installation
```python
!python -m pip install git+https://github.com/speechbrain/speechbrain.git@develop
```

Here's the condensed version of the tutorial chunk, focusing on key implementation details and concepts:

# Audio Preparation and Beamforming Implementation

## Audio Setup and Processing

```python
# Load audio samples
xs_speech = read_audio('speech_-0.82918_0.55279_-0.082918.flac').unsqueeze(0)
xs_noise_diff = read_audio('noise_diffuse.flac').unsqueeze(0)
xs_noise_loc = read_audio('noise_0.70225_-0.70225_0.11704.flac').unsqueeze(0)
fs = 16000  # sampling rate

# Create noisy mixtures
ss = xs_speech
nn_diff = 0.05 * xs_noise_diff  # diffuse noise
nn_loc = 0.05 * xs_noise_loc    # localized noise
xs_diffused_noise = ss + nn_diff
xs_localized_noise = ss + nn_loc
```

## Key Beamforming Implementations

### 1. SRP-PHAT (Steered-Response Power with Phase Transform)
```python
# Setup microphone array geometry
mics = torch.zeros((4,3), dtype=torch.float)
mics[0,:] = torch.FloatTensor([-0.05, -0.05, +0.00])
mics[1,:] = torch.FloatTensor([-0.05, +0.05, +0.00])
mics[2,:] = torch.FloatTensor([+0.05, +0.05, +0.00])
mics[3,:] = torch.FloatTensor([+0.05, +0.05, +0.00])

# Processing pipeline
stft = STFT(sample_rate=fs)
cov = Covariance()
srpphat = SrpPhat(mics=mics)

Xs = stft(xs_diffused_noise)
XXs = cov(Xs)
doas = srpphat(XXs)
```

### 2. MUSIC (Multiple Signal Classification)
```python
music = Music(mics=mics)
doas = music(XXs)  # Uses same STFT and covariance as SRP-PHAT
```

### 3. Delay-and-Sum Beamforming
```python
stft = STFT(sample_rate=fs)
cov = Covariance()
gccphat = GccPhat()
delaysum = DelaySum()
istft = ISTFT(sample_rate=fs)

# Processing pipeline
Xs = stft(xs_diffused_noise)
XXs = cov(Xs)
tdoas = gccphat(XXs)
Ys_ds = delaysum(Xs, tdoas)
ys_ds = istft(Ys_ds)
```

## Important Notes:
1. The microphone array is configured as a circular array with 4 mics (diameter 0.1m)
2. All microphones lie on the xy-plane, making z-axis distinction impossible
3. The system estimates DOA for each STFT frame
4. Slight direction differences may occur due to sphere discretization

## Key Parameters:
- Sampling rate: 16000 Hz
- Noise scaling factor: 0.05
- Microphone spacing: 0.1m diameter circular array
- Array configuration: 4-microphone uniform circular array

This implementation demonstrates three different beamforming techniques: SRP-PHAT, MUSIC, and Delay-and-Sum, each suitable for different acoustic scenarios and requirements.

Here's the condensed tutorial focusing on key implementation details and techniques:

# Multi-Channel Speech Processing Implementation Guide

## Key Components and Techniques

### 1. Speech with Directive Noise
- GCC-PHAT can capture TDOAs from both speech and noise sources
- Ideal binary mask recommended to differentiate speech TDOAs from noise TDOAs
- Implementation requires careful TDOA handling

### 2. Core Processing Pipeline
```python
from speechbrain.processing.features import STFT, ISTFT
from speechbrain.processing.multi_mic import Covariance, GccPhat, DelaySum, Mvdr, Gev

# Initialize components
stft = STFT(sample_rate=fs)
cov = Covariance()
gccphat = GccPhat()
delaysum = DelaySum()  # or mvdr = Mvdr() or gev = Gev()
istft = ISTFT(sample_rate=fs)

# Basic processing flow
Xs = stft(input_signal)
XXs = cov(Xs)
tdoas = gccphat(XXs)
```

### 3. Beamforming Techniques

#### Delay-Sum Beamforming
```python
# After STFT and TDOA estimation
Ys_ds = delaysum(Xs, tdoas)
ys_ds = istft(Ys_ds)
```

#### MVDR Beamforming
```python
# Additional noise processing
Nn = stft(noise_signal)
NNs = cov(Nn)
Ys_mvdr = mvdr(Xs, NNs, tdoas)
ys_mvdr = istft(Ys_mvdr)
```

#### GEV Beamforming
```python
# Requires speech and noise covariance
Ss = stft(speech_signal)
Nn = stft(noise_signal)
SSs = cov(Ss)
NNs = cov(Nn)
Ys_gev = gev(Xs, SSs, NNs)
ys_gev = istft(Ys_gev)
```

## Important Considerations

1. **TDOA Handling**:
   - Critical for directive noise scenarios
   - Consider using binary masks for TDOA differentiation

2. **Covariance Estimation**:
   - Computed per frequency bin
   - Essential for MVDR and GEV beamforming

3. **Signal Processing Flow**:
   - STFT → Covariance → TDOA estimation → Beamforming → ISTFT

4. **Visualization**:
   - Use spectrograms and waveforms to verify processing
   - Monitor both time and frequency domain representations

This implementation supports processing of both diffuse and directive noise scenarios, with different beamforming techniques offering varying levels of noise reduction effectiveness.
