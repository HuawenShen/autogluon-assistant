Here's the condensed tutorial focusing on key implementation details and concepts:

# Speech Augmentation in SpeechBrain

## Key Augmentation Techniques

### 1. Speed Perturbation
```python
from speechbrain.augment.time_domain import SpeedPerturb

# Initialize with original frequency and speed factors
perturbator = SpeedPerturb(orig_freq=16000, speeds=[90])

# Apply to audio (requires batch dimension)
clean = signal.unsqueeze(0)  # [batch, time]
perturbed = perturbator(clean)
```

**Key Parameters:**
- `orig_freq`: Original sampling frequency
- `speeds`: List of speed percentages (e.g., [90, 100, 110])

### 2. Time Dropout (Chunk Drop)
```python
from speechbrain.augment.time_domain import DropChunk

dropper = DropChunk(
    drop_length_low=2000,
    drop_length_high=3000, 
    drop_count_low=5,
    drop_count_high=10
)

# Apply with length tensor for batch processing
dropped_signal = dropper(clean, length=torch.ones(1))
```

**Key Parameters:**
- `drop_length_low/high`: Min/max length of zero chunks
- `drop_count_low/high`: Min/max number of chunks to drop

### 3. Frequency Dropout
```python
from speechbrain.augment.time_domain import DropFreq

dropper = DropFreq(
    drop_freq_count_low=5,
    drop_freq_count_high=8
)
dropped_signal = dropper(clean)
```

**Key Parameters:**
- `drop_freq_count_low/high`: Number of frequency bands to drop
- `drop_freq_low/high`: Min/max frequencies to drop
- `drop_width`: Width of frequency band to drop

### 4. Clipping
```python
from speechbrain.augment.time_domain import DoClip

clipper = DoClip(clip_low=0.7, clip_high=0.7)
clipped_signal = clipper(signal.unsqueeze(0))
```

**Key Parameters:**
- `clip_low/high`: Lower/upper thresholds for signal clamping

### 5. Combined Augmentation Pipeline
```python
from speechbrain.augment.augmenter import Augmenter

augment = Augmenter(
    parallel_augment=False,
    concat_original=False,
    min_augmentations=2,
    max_augmentations=2,
    shuffle_augmentations=False,
    repeat_augment=1,
    augmentations=[freq_dropper, chunk_dropper]
)

augmented_signal, lengths = augment(clean, lengths=torch.tensor([1.0]))
```

**Important Configuration Options:**
- `parallel_augment`: If True, applies augmentations separately
- `concat_original`: Include original signal in output
- `min/max_augmentations`: Range of augmentations to apply
- `shuffle_augmentations`: Randomize augmentation order
- `repeat_augment`: Number of times to repeat pipeline

## Best Practices
1. Always add batch dimension before augmentation
2. Use length tensors for batch processing with variable lengths
3. Combine multiple augmentations using the Augmenter class
4. Adjust augmentation parameters based on your specific use case
5. Consider using parallel augmentation for data diversity

## Implementation Notes
- All augmentations expect input shape: [batch, time]
- Length tensors are required for batch processing
- Augmentations can be applied sequentially or in parallel
- Parameters can be randomized within specified ranges
