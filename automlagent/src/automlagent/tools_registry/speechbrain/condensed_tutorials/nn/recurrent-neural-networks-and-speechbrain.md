Summary: This tutorial provides implementation details for various RNN architectures in SpeechBrain, including Vanilla RNN, LSTM, GRU, and LiGRU. It covers code examples for handling sequential data with shape [batch, time, features], demonstrating how to configure bidirectional and multi-layer architectures. The tutorial specifically helps with implementing memory-efficient LiGRU networks, which feature single multiplicative gates and BatchNorm integration. Key functionalities include gradient handling techniques, parameter sharing in bidirectional modes, and architectural variations for different sequence modeling tasks. The implementation knowledge spans from basic RNN setup to advanced optimization strategies for speech processing and general sequence modeling applications.

Here's the condensed tutorial focusing on essential implementation details and key concepts:

# Recurrent Neural Networks in SpeechBrain

## Key Concepts
- RNNs process sequences using feedback connections and memory
- Core equation: `hₜ = f(xₜ, hₜ₋₁, θ)`
- Training requires network unfolding over time axis
- Parameters are shared across time steps

## 1. Vanilla RNN

### Implementation
```python
from speechbrain.nnet.RNN import RNN

# Basic usage
inp_tensor = torch.rand([4, 10, 20])  # [batch, time, features]
net = RNN(hidden_size=5, input_shape=inp_tensor.shape)
out_tensor, _ = net(inp_tensor)
```

### Key Parameters
- Input format: `[batch, time, features]`
- Parameters:
  - W: input-to-hidden matrix `[hidden_size, input_dim]`
  - U: hidden-to-hidden matrix `[hidden_size, hidden_size]`
  - b: bias vectors

### Important Features
```python
# Bidirectional RNN
net = RNN(hidden_size=5,
          input_shape=inp_tensor.shape,
          bidirectional=True)  # Output features double

# Multi-layer RNN
net = RNN(hidden_size=5,
          input_shape=inp_tensor.shape,
          num_layers=3)
```

## 2. LSTM (Long-Short Term Memory)

### Implementation
```python
from speechbrain.nnet.RNN import LSTM

inp_tensor = torch.rand([4, 10, 20])
net = LSTM(hidden_size=5, input_shape=inp_tensor.shape)
out_tensor, _ = net(inp_tensor)
```

### Architecture
- Uses memory cells with three gates:
  - Forget gate (f)
  - Input gate (i)
  - Output gate (o)
- Cell state equations provided in mathematical notation
- Better suited for learning long-term dependencies

### Parameter Organization
- Parameters grouped in consolidated tensors:
  - `rnn.weight_ih_l0`: All input-to-hidden matrices
  - `rnn.weight_hh_l0`: All hidden-to-hidden matrices
  - Corresponding bias terms

## Best Practices & Warnings
1. Handle gradient issues:
   - Use gradient clipping for exploding gradients
   - Consider gradient shortcuts for vanishing gradients
2. Follow input tensor format: `[batch, time, features]`
3. Consider bidirectional architecture for better context modeling
4. Stack layers for deeper feature extraction

Here's the condensed tutorial focusing on key implementation details and concepts:

# Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) and Light GRUs

## GRU Implementation
GRUs simplify LSTM architecture using only two multiplicative gates:

Key equations:
```
zt = σ(Wzxt + Uzht-1 + bz)
rt = σ(Wrxt + Urht-1 + br)
h̃t = tanh(Whxt + Uh(ht-1 ⊙ rt) + bh)
ht = zt ⊙ ht-1 + (1-zt) ⊙ h̃t
```

### Basic GRU Implementation in SpeechBrain
```python
from speechbrain.nnet.RNN import GRU

# Input shape: [batch, time, features]
inp_tensor = torch.rand([4, 10, 20]) 
net = GRU(hidden_size=5, input_shape=inp_tensor.shape)
out_tensor, _ = net(inp_tensor)
```

## Light GRU (LiGRU)
Key improvements over standard GRU:
1. Single multiplicative gate (removes reset gate)
2. Uses ReLU + BatchNorm instead of tanh
3. Shared parameters in bidirectional mode

Key equations:
```
zt = σ(BN(Wzxt) + Uzht-1)
h̃t = ReLU(BN(Whxt) + Uhht-1)
ht = zt ⊙ ht-1 + (1-zt) ⊙ h̃t
```

### LiGRU Implementation
```python
from speechbrain.nnet.RNN import LiGRU

# Basic usage
net = LiGRU(hidden_size=5, input_shape=inp_tensor.shape)

# Bidirectional implementation
net_bi = LiGRU(
    hidden_size=5,
    input_shape=inp_tensor.shape,
    bidirectional=True
)
```

## Performance Comparison
```python
# Configuration for comparison
hidden_size = 512
num_layers = 4
bidirectional = True
inp_tensor = torch.rand([4, 10, 80])

# Model parameter counts (example)
RNN: ~X.XX M
LSTM: ~X.XX M
GRU: ~X.XX M
LiGRU: ~X.XX M
```

### Key Benefits of LiGRU:
- Parameter efficient (comparable to vanilla RNN)
- Maintains long-term dependency learning
- Better numerical stability through BatchNorm
- Shared parameters in bidirectional mode reduces memory footprint

### Best Practices:
1. Use LiGRU when parameter efficiency is crucial
2. Consider bidirectional LiGRU for sequence tasks
3. BatchNorm is essential for LiGRU stability
4. Monitor gradient flow in deep architectures

This implementation focuses on speech processing tasks but can be adapted for other sequence modeling problems.
