*This is a condensed version that preserves essential implementation details and context.*

Here's the condensed tutorial introduction, focusing on key implementation details and concepts:

# Speech Recognition From Scratch with SpeechBrain

## Key Architectures

### 1. Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC)
- Simplest speech recognition system
- Uses *blank* token for uncertain predictions
- Employs dynamic programming for alignment
- Cost function: sum of probabilities across all possible alignments
- Implemented as specialized cost function on top of speech recognizer (typically RNN-based)

### 2. Transducers
- Enhances CTC with:
  - Autoregressive predictor
  - Join network
- Components:
  - Encoder: converts input features to encoded representations
  - Predictor: generates latent representation from previous outputs
  - Join network: combines encoder and predictor outputs
  - Softmax classifier: predicts current token

### 3. Encoder-Decoder with Attention
```python
# Architecture Overview
encoder = process_speech_features() -> h_states
decoder = generate_output_tokens(last_hidden_state, previous_output)
attention = dynamic_connection(encoder_states, decoder_states)
```

Key Features:
- Encoder processes speech features/raw samples
- Autoregressive decoder with eos token detection
- Supports multiple neural architectures (RNN, CNN, Transformer)
- Various attention types: content, location-aware, key-value
- Optional CTC loss for convergence enhancement

## Implementation Steps

1. **Data Preparation**
```python
# Generate manifest files (CSV/JSON)
# Use mini_librispeech_prepare.py for example data
```

2. **Tokenizer Training**
```bash
cd speechbrain/templates/speech_recognition/Tokenizer
python train.py tokenizer.yaml
```

3. **Language Model Training**
```bash
pip install datasets
cd speechbrain/templates/speech_recognition/LM
python train.py RNNLM.yaml
```

4. **Speech Recognizer Training**
```bash
cd speechbrain/templates/speech_recognition/ASR
python train.py train.yaml
```

## Installation
```python
# GPU recommended for performance
!python -m pip install git+https://github.com/speechbrain/speechbrain.git@develop
!git clone https://github.com/speechbrain/speechbrain/
```

⚠️ **Important Notes**:
- Use GPU for efficient training
- Mini-librispeech is used for demonstration (real applications need 100+ hours)
- Choose appropriate basic units (characters, phonemes, sub-words) for tokenizer
- Language model should match target domain
- Refer to SpeechBrain templates for implementation examples

Here's the condensed version focusing on key implementation details and concepts:

# Data Preparation and Tokenization for Speech Recognition

## 1. Data Manifest Files

### Key Structure
```json
{
  "utterance_id": {
    "wav": "{data_root}/path/to/audio.flac",
    "length": 16.09,
    "words": "TRANSCRIPTION TEXT"
  }
}
```

**Important Details:**
- Uses JSON format for manifest files
- `data_root` variable allows dynamic data folder changes
- Each entry contains audio path, length, and transcription

## 2. Data Preparation

### Implementation Steps
1. Create preparation script based on dataset format
2. Use [mini_librispeech_prepare.py](https://github.com/speechbrain/speechbrain/blob/develop/templates/speech_recognition/mini_librispeech_prepare.py) as template
3. Generate separate manifests for train/valid/test
4. Consider copying data locally in HPC environments for performance

## 3. Tokenization Options

### 1. Character-based
```python
"THE CITY" => ['T','H','E','_','C','I','T','Y']
```
- Pros: Small token set, generalizes to unseen words
- Cons: Long sequences to predict

### 2. Word-based
```python
"THE CITY" => ['THE','CITY']
```
- Pros: Short sequences
- Cons: Can't handle unseen words, large vocabulary

### 3. Byte Pair Encoding (BPE)
```python
"THE CITY" => ['THE', '▁CI', 'TY']
```
- Recommended approach
- Balances sequence length and vocabulary size
- Typical vocabulary: 1k-10k tokens for LibriSpeech-sized datasets

## Implementation Code

### Train Tokenizer
```bash
cd speechbrain/templates/speech_recognition/Tokenizer
python train.py tokenizer.yaml
```

### Key Configuration (tokenizer.yaml)
```yaml
data_folder: ../data
output_folder: ./save
token_type: unigram  # ["unigram", "bpe", "char"]
token_output: 1000  # vocabulary size
character_coverage: 1.0
annotation_read: words
```

**Best Practices:**
- Choose tokenization strategy based on dataset size and requirements
- Experiment with different BPE vocabulary sizes
- Consider computational resources when selecting token granularity
- Ensure consistent tokenization across training and inference

Here's the condensed version focusing on essential implementation details:

### Tokenizer Implementation

```yaml
# Core tokenizer configuration
tokenizer: !name:speechbrain.tokenizers.SentencePiece.SentencePiece
   model_dir: !ref <output_folder>
   vocab_size: !ref <token_output>
   annotation_train: !ref <train_annotation>
   model_type: !ref <token_type> # ["unigram", "bpe", "char"]
   character_coverage: !ref <character_coverage>
```

**Key Implementation Details:**
- Uses SentencePiece tokenizer with unigram smoothing variant of BPE
- Trained on training annotations only
- Vocabulary size set to 1000
- Saves model in specified `output_folder`

### Using the Tokenizer

```python
# Load and use tokenizer
sp = spm.SentencePieceProcessor()
sp.load("path/to/1000_unigram.model")

# Example usage
sp.encode_as_pieces('THE CITY OF MONTREAL')  # Returns pieces
sp.encode_as_ids('THE CITY OF MONTREAL')     # Returns token IDs
```

### Critical Configurations

```yaml
# Core training parameters
number_of_epochs: 20
batch_size: 80
lr: 0.001

# Model architecture
emb_dim: 256
rnn_size: 512
layers: 2
output_neurons: 1000

# Optimization
optimizer: !name:torch.optim.Adam
    lr: !ref <lr>
    betas: (0.9, 0.98)
    eps: 0.000000001
```

### Important Files Generated
- `1000_unigram.model`: Binary file for tokenization
- `1000_unigram.vocab`: Text file with tokens and probabilities
- Training logs and checkpoints in `save/` directory

### Best Practices
1. Store checkpoints for both best and latest models
2. Maintain copies of training scripts and hyperparameters for reproducibility
3. Use the pretrainer class to manage tokenizer loading
4. Monitor both training and validation losses during training

### Warning
- Ensure tokenizer is trained only on training data to prevent data leakage
- Keep track of tokenizer model path for consistent usage across training and inference

This implementation provides a foundation for text tokenization in speech recognition tasks, with the tokenizer being a crucial component for subsequent language model training.

Here's the condensed version focusing on key implementation details:

# Language Model Training Implementation

## Main Setup
```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Parse arguments and load hyperparameters
    hparams_file, run_opts, overrides = sb.parse_arguments(sys.argv[1:])
    sb.utils.distributed.ddp_init_group(run_opts)  # Initialize multi-GPU support
    
    # Load hyperparameters and create experiment directory
    with open(hparams_file) as fin:
        hparams = load_hyperpyyaml(fin, overrides)
    sb.create_experiment_directory(
        experiment_directory=hparams["output_folder"],
        hyperparams_to_save=hparams_file,
        overrides=overrides,
    )
```

## Data Pipeline Implementation
```python
def dataio_prepare(hparams):
    # Load datasets using HuggingFace datasets
    datasets = load_dataset(
        "text",
        data_files={
            "train": hparams["lm_train_data"],
            "valid": hparams["lm_valid_data"],
            "test": hparams["lm_test_data"],
        },
    )
    
    # Convert to SpeechBrain's DynamicItemDataset
    train_data = sb.dataio.dataset.DynamicItemDataset.from_arrow_dataset(datasets["train"])
    valid_data = sb.dataio.dataset.DynamicItemDataset.from_arrow_dataset(datasets["valid"])
    test_data = sb.dataio.dataset.DynamicItemDataset.from_arrow_dataset(datasets["test"])
    
    # Define text processing pipeline
    @sb.utils.data_pipeline.takes("text")
    @sb.utils.data_pipeline.provides("text", "tokens_bos", "tokens_eos")
    def text_pipeline(text):
        yield text
        tokens_list = tokenizer.encode_as_ids(text)
        tokens_bos = torch.LongTensor([hparams["bos_index"]] + (tokens_list))
        yield tokens_bos
        tokens_eos = torch.LongTensor(tokens_list + [hparams["eos_index"]])
        yield tokens_eos
```

## Key Components and Features:

1. **Data Processing Pipeline**:
   - Converts raw text to token indices
   - Adds beginning-of-sentence (BOS) and end-of-sentence (EOS) tokens
   - Creates shifted sequences for language model training

2. **Forward Computation**:
```python
def compute_forward(self, batch, stage):
    batch = batch.to(self.device)
    tokens_bos, _ = batch.tokens_bos
    pred = self.hparams.model(tokens_bos)
    return pred
```

3. **Important Notes**:
   - Uses BOS-shifted tokens as input for predicting the next token
   - Supports multi-GPU training through DDP initialization
   - Implements dynamic data loading through SpeechBrain's DynamicItemDataset

4. **Training Execution**:
```python
lm_brain = LM(
    modules=hparams["modules"],
    opt_class=hparams["optimizer"],
    hparams=hparams,
    run_opts=run_opts,
    checkpointer=hparams["checkpointer"],
)
lm_brain.fit(
    lm_brain.hparams.epoch_counter,
    train_data,
    valid_data,
    train_loader_kwargs=hparams["train_dataloader_opts"],
    valid_loader_kwargs=hparams["valid_dataloader_opts"],
)
```
