Summary: This tutorial provides implementation details for Voice Activity Detection (VAD) using a CRDNN architecture in SpeechBrain. It covers techniques for detecting speech segments in audio recordings through a complete processing pipeline including posterior probability computation, threshold application, and post-processing steps. The tutorial helps with tasks like speech segment detection, boundary computation, and VAD signal generation. Key features include handling long recordings, customizable post-processing parameters (merging segments, removing short segments, speech verification), energy-based VAD integration, and visualization utilities. The implementation emphasizes practical aspects like memory management through chunk processing and best practices for threshold selection, making it suitable for real-world applications in noisy and reverberant conditions.

*This is a condensed version that preserves essential implementation details and context.*

Here's the condensed tutorial focusing on key implementation details and concepts:

# Voice Activity Detection (VAD) Implementation Guide

## Core Concepts
- **Purpose**: Detect speech segments within audio recordings
- **Output**: Binary sequence (1=speech, 0=non-speech) or segment boundaries
- **Common Use**: Pre-processing step for speech recognition, enhancement, and diarization

## Implementation Architecture

### Model Structure
- Uses CRDNN (Convolutional + Recurrent + Dense Neural Network)
- Input: FBANK features
- Output: Binary classification through sigmoid activation
- Training: Binary cross-entropy loss

### Processing Pipeline
1. Posterior probability computation (frame-level)
2. Threshold application
3. Speech segment candidate detection
4. Post-processing steps:
   - Energy VAD (optional)
   - Segment merging
   - Short segment removal
   - Speech verification (optional)

## Code Implementation

```python
# Basic Usage
from speechbrain.inference.VAD import VAD

# Initialize VAD model
vad = VAD.from_hparams(
    source="speechbrain/vad-crdnn-libriparty", 
    savedir="pretrained_models/vad-crdnn-libriparty"
)

# Get speech segments
boundaries = vad.get_speech_segments(audio_file)
vad.save_boundaries(boundaries)
```

## Training Details

```bash
cd recipes/LibriParty/VAD
python train.py hparams/train.yaml
```

### Training Data
- Uses LibriParty Dataset
- On-the-fly acoustic scene simulation using:
  - Musan (speech, noise, music)
  - CommonLanguage (48 languages)
  - Open-rir (noise and impulse responses)

## Key Features
- Handles long recordings efficiently
- Supports customizable post-processing
- Modular pipeline design for easy debugging
- Works in noisy and reverberant conditions

## Best Practices
- Ensure all data dependencies are downloaded before training
- Customize post-processing parameters based on use case
- Consider computational resources for long recordings
- Validate performance in target acoustic conditions

This implementation is designed for robustness in real-world conditions while maintaining flexibility for different use cases.

Here's the condensed tutorial focusing on key implementation details and practices:

# VAD Implementation Guide

## 1. Posterior Computation
```python
# Get speech probabilities (10ms resolution)
prob_chunks = VAD.get_speech_prob_file(audio_file)

# Key parameters:
# - large_chunk_size: For memory management (e.g., 30 sec)
# - small_chunk_size: For parallel processing (e.g., 10 sec)
```

**Best Practice**: Adjust chunk sizes based on available memory. Larger chunks = slightly faster processing.

## 2. Threshold Application
```python
prob_th = VAD.apply_threshold(
    prob_chunks, 
    activation_th=0.5,    # Start speech segment
    deactivation_th=0.25  # End speech segment
)
```

**Important**: Set activation_th higher than deactivation_th for better detection.

## 3. Boundary Detection
```python
boundaries = VAD.get_boundaries(prob_th)
VAD.save_boundaries(boundaries, audio_file=audio_file)
```

## 4. Energy-based VAD (Optional)
```python
# For finer segmentation within detected speech segments
boundaries = VAD.energy_VAD(
    audio_file,
    boundaries, 
    activation_th=0.8, 
    deactivation_th=0.0
)
```

## 5. Post-processing Steps

### Merge Close Segments
```python
boundaries = VAD.merge_close_segments(boundaries, close_th=0.250)  # 250ms threshold
```

### Remove Short Segments
```python
boundaries = VAD.remove_short_segments(boundaries, len_th=0.250)  # 250ms threshold
```

### Double Check Speech Segments
```python
boundaries = VAD.double_check_speech_segments(
    boundaries, 
    audio_file,  
    speech_th=0.5
)
```

## Visualization Utilities
```python
# Create VAD signal matching audio dimensions
upsampled_boundaries = VAD.upsample_boundaries(boundaries, audio_file)

# Plot with original signal
time = torch.linspace(0, signal.shape[0]/fs, steps=signal.shape[0])
plt.plot(time, signal)
plt.plot(time, upsampled_boundaries.squeeze())

# Include VAD scores
upsampled_vad_scores = VAD.upsample_VAD(prob_chunks, audio_file)
```

**Important Processing Order**:
1. Apply neural VAD
2. Apply energy-based VAD (if needed)
3. Merge close segments
4. Remove short segments
5. Double-check speech segments

**Warning**: The order of post-processing operations matters, especially when using energy-based VAD. Incorrect ordering can lead to dropped speech frames.

Here's the condensed version focusing on the key implementation details and code:

# Voice Activity Detection (VAD) - Final Processing Steps

## 3. Post-Processing Operations

### 3a. Merging Close Segments
```python
# Merge segments that are close to each other
boundaries = VAD.merge_close_segments(boundaries_energy, close_th=0.250)
```
- Combines voice segments that are separated by less than 250ms
- Helps reduce fragmentation in detection

### 3b. Short Segment Removal and Verification
```python
# Remove short segments and verify speech segments
boundaries = VAD.remove_short_segments(boundaries, len_th=0.250)
boundaries = VAD.double_check_speech_segments(
    boundaries, 
    audio_file,  
    speech_th=0.5
)
```

Key Parameters:
- `len_th`: Minimum segment length threshold (250ms)
- `speech_th`: Speech confidence threshold (0.5)

Best Practices:
1. Adjust thresholds based on your specific use case
2. Consider the trade-off between merging segments and maintaining accuracy
3. Always verify the final boundaries against the original audio
