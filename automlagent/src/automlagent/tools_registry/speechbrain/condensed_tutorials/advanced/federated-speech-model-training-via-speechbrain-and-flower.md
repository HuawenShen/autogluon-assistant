# Condensed: <!-- This cell is automatically updated by tools/tutorial-cell-updater.py -->

Summary: This tutorial demonstrates implementing federated learning for speech recognition by combining SpeechBrain and Flower frameworks. It covers the implementation of a custom Brain class extending SpeechBrain's core functionality, a federated learning client (SpeechBrainClient), and a custom aggregation strategy (TrainAfterAggregateStrategy). Key technical features include three aggregation strategies (standard FedAvg, loss-based, and WER-based), post-aggregation server-side training, weight management functions for model parameter handling, and integration with pre-trained models. The tutorial provides code for essential components like data preparation, model initialization, training loops, and evaluation processes, making it particularly useful for implementing distributed speech recognition systems with federated learning capabilities.

*This is a condensed version that preserves essential implementation details and context.*

Here's the condensed version focusing on the key implementation details:

### Brain Class Implementation for Federated Learning

```python
class ASR(sb.core.Brain):
    """Custom Brain class extending SpeechBrain for Federated Learning"""
    
    # Required core methods with their essential signatures:
    def compute_forward(self, batch, stage):
        """Forward pass computation
        Returns: model predictions"""
        pass

    def compute_objectives(self, predictions, batch, stage):
        """Loss computation
        Returns: loss tensor"""
        pass

    def fit_batch(self, batch):
        """Single batch training
        Returns: detached loss"""
        pass

    def evaluate_batch(self, batch, stage):
        """Single batch evaluation
        Returns: detached loss"""
        pass

    def fit(
        self,
        epoch_counter,
        train_set,
        valid_set=None,
        progressbar=None,
        train_loader_kwargs={},
        valid_loader_kwargs={},
    ):
        """Training loop implementation
        Returns: processed samples count, avg loss, avg WER"""
        pass

    def evaluate(
        self,
        test_set,
        progressbar=None,
        test_loader_kwargs={},
    ):
        """Evaluation implementation
        Returns: average test loss"""
        pass
```

**Key Points:**
1. Extends SpeechBrain's core Brain class
2. Override required for Flower's federated learning to track processed samples
3. Main modification is in `fit()` method to return:
   - Number of processed samples
   - Average training loss
   - Average Word Error Rate (WER)
4. Other methods maintain standard SpeechBrain implementation

**Important Note:**
The implementation is largely identical to standard SpeechBrain, with the key difference being the return of processed sample counts for federated aggregation.

Here's the condensed version of the training loop implementation focusing on key details:

# Training Loop Implementation

## Key Components

### Fit Method Overview
```python
def fit(self, epoch_counter, train_set, valid_set=None, progressbar=None, 
        train_loader_kwargs={}, valid_loader_kwargs={}):
```

### Critical Implementation Details

1. **Data Loading Setup**
```python
# Convert datasets to DataLoader if needed
train_set = self.make_dataloader(
    train_set, 
    stage=sb.Stage.TRAIN, 
    **train_loader_kwargs
)
```

2. **Training Loop Structure**
```python
for epoch in epoch_counter:
    # Training phase
    self.modules.train()
    avg_wer = 0.0
    self.nonfinite_count = 0
    
    # Main training loop
    with tqdm(train_set, initial=self.step, dynamic_ncols=True) as t:
        for batch in t:
            loss, wer = self.fit_batch(batch)
            self.avg_train_loss = self.update_average(loss, self.avg_train_loss)
            avg_wer = self.update_average_wer(wer, avg_wer)
```

3. **Validation Phase**
```python
if valid_set is not None:
    self.modules.eval()
    with torch.no_grad():
        for batch in tqdm(valid_set):
            loss = self.evaluate_batch(batch, stage=sb.Stage.VALID)
            avg_valid_loss = self.update_average(loss, avg_valid_loss)
```

## Important Features

- **Checkpoint Management**: Supports intra-epoch checkpointing based on time intervals
- **Progress Tracking**: Uses tqdm for progress visualization
- **Distributed Training**: Handles distributed training scenarios with sampler epoch updates
- **Debug Mode**: Supports limited batches/epochs for debugging

## Key Parameters

- `epoch_counter`: Controls training duration
- `train_set`: Training dataset
- `valid_set`: Validation dataset (optional)
- `progressbar`: Toggle progress display
- `train_loader_kwargs`: Training DataLoader configuration
- `valid_loader_kwargs`: Validation DataLoader configuration

## Returns
- `batch_count`: Total processed batches
- `avg_loss`: Final training loss
- `valid_wer_last`: Final validation WER (if validation performed)

## Best Practices
1. Use appropriate DataLoader configurations for training and validation
2. Enable checkpointing for long training sessions
3. Monitor both training and validation metrics
4. Use debug mode for initial testing

# Federated Speech Model Training with Flower and SpeechBrain

## Key Components & Setup

### Installation
```python
# Install SpeechBrain
!python -m pip install git+https://github.com/speechbrain/speechbrain.git@develop

# Install Flower
!pip install flwr
!pip install tqdm==4.50.2
```

### Core Features
1. Pre-trained model loading capability
2. Three aggregation strategies:
   - Standard FedAvg
   - Loss-based
   - WER-based aggregation
3. Server-side training with held-out dataset post-aggregation

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Data Preparation
- Create TSV format data manifest files for SpeechBrain
- Files contain speech data locations and text annotations
- Example using template dataset:
```python
%cd /content/Flower-SpeechBrain/temp_dataset/
# Unzip and prepare data
un_zip("temp_dataset.zip")
%cp temp_dataset.tsv train_0.tsv
```

### 2. Server Configuration
```bash
# Key server parameters
--min_fit_clients=1
--min_available_clients=1
--rounds=1
--local_epochs=1
--server_address="localhost:24338"
```

### 3. Client Configuration
```bash
# Key client parameters
--cid=$i
--eval_device="cuda:0"
--server_address="localhost:24338"
```

### 4. Integration Steps
1. Define Brain class (SpeechBrain)
2. Initialize Brain class and dataset
3. Define SpeechBrain Client (Flower client)
4. Define Flower Strategy (server-side)

## Best Practices
- Use GPU for faster execution
- Ensure familiarity with both SpeechBrain and Flower before implementation
- For production use, use larger datasets (100+ hours) for acceptable performance
- Allow proper initialization time between server and client startup (5s delay recommended)

## Technical Requirements
- GPU runtime recommended
- Compatible versions of tqdm and other dependencies
- Proper network configuration for server-client communication

This implementation uses ASR as an example but can be adapted for other speech-related tasks following the same pattern.

Here's the condensed version focusing on key implementation details:

# Model and Dataset Initialization

## Key Implementation Details

The `int_model` function handles model and dataset initialization for federated learning with SpeechBrain:

```python
def int_model(
    flower_path,
    tr_path,
    dev_path,
    test_path,
    save_path,
    data_path,
    config_file="CRDNN.yaml",
    tokenizer_path=None,
    eval_device="cuda:0",
    evaluate=False,
    add_train=False):
```

### Critical Components

1. **Hyperparameter Loading**:
```python
# Load and override hyperparameters
params_file = flower_path + config_file
overrides = {
    "output_folder": save_path,
    "number_of_epochs": 1,
    "test_batch_size": 4,
    "device": eval_device,
} if evaluate else {"output_folder": save_path}
```

2. **Dataset Preparation**:
```python
# Dataset setup
run_on_main(
    prepare_common_voice,
    kwargs={
        "data_folder": params["data_folder"],
        "save_folder": params["save_folder"],
        "train_tsv_file": params["train_tsv_file"],
        "dev_tsv_file": params["dev_tsv_file"],
        "test_tsv_file": params["test_tsv_file"],
        "accented_letters": params["accented_letters"],
        "language": params["language"],
    },
)
```

3. **Tokenizer Initialization**:
```python
tokenizer = SentencePiece(
    model_dir=params["save_folder"],
    vocab_size=params["output_neurons"],
    annotation_train=params["train_csv"],
    annotation_read="wrd",
    model_type=params["token_type"],
    character_coverage=params["character_coverage"],
)
```

4. **ASR Brain Setup**:
```python
asr_brain = ASR(
    modules=params["modules"],
    hparams=params,
    run_opts=run_opts,
    opt_class=params["opt_class"],
    checkpointer=params["checkpointer"],
)
asr_brain.tokenizer = tokenizer
```

## Important Notes
- Function is designed for Flower's federated learning setup
- Supports different configurations for evaluation and training modes
- Allows hyperparameter overrides through YAML configuration
- Returns initialized ASR brain and dataset objects

## Usage
```python
asr_brain, dataset = int_model(...)
```

# SpeechBrain Client Implementation

## Core Weight Management Functions

```python
def set_weights(weights, modules, device) -> None:
    """Set model weights from NumPy ndarrays to PyTorch modules"""
    state_dict = OrderedDict()
    valid_keys = [k for k in modules.state_dict().keys()]
    for k, v in zip(valid_keys, weights):
        state_dict[k] = torch.Tensor(np.array(v)).to(device)
    modules.load_state_dict(state_dict, strict=False)

def get_weights(modules):
    """Extract model weights as NumPy ndarrays"""
    return [v.cpu().numpy() for k, v in modules.state_dict().items()]
```
