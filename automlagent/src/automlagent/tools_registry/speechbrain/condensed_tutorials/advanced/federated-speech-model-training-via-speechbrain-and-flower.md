# Condensed: <!-- This cell is automatically updated by tools/tutorial-cell-updater.py -->

Summary: This tutorial demonstrates implementing federated learning for Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) using SpeechBrain and Flower frameworks. It covers the implementation of a custom ASR Brain class with federation support, training loop mechanics, and three different aggregation strategies (FedAvg, loss-based, and WER-based). Key technical components include weight management functions, client-server architecture setup, model/dataset initialization, and a custom TrainAfterAggregateStrategy class that enables post-aggregation server-side training. The tutorial helps with tasks like implementing federated ASR systems, managing distributed training loops, and handling model weight aggregation. Notable features include GPU optimization, checkpoint management, progress tracking, and support for pre-trained models with flexible configuration options.

*This is a condensed version that preserves essential implementation details and context.*

Here's the condensed version focusing on the key implementation details:

### ASR Brain Class Implementation

```python
class ASR(sb.core.Brain):
    """Custom Brain class for ASR with Flower federation support"""
    
    # Key methods that must be implemented:
    def compute_forward(self, batch, stage):
        """Forward pass computation
        Returns: model output tensors"""
        pass

    def compute_objectives(self, predictions, batch, stage):
        """Loss computation
        Returns: loss tensor"""
        pass

    def fit_batch(self, batch):
        """Single batch training
        Returns: detached loss"""
        pass

    def evaluate_batch(self, batch, stage):
        """Single batch evaluation
        Returns: detached loss"""
        pass

    def fit(self, epoch_counter, train_set, valid_set=None, 
            progressbar=None, train_loader_kwargs={}, 
            valid_loader_kwargs={}):
        """Training loop implementation
        Returns: processed samples count, avg loss, avg WER"""
        pass

    def evaluate(self, test_set, progressbar=None, 
                test_loader_kwargs={}):
        """Evaluation loop implementation
        Returns: average test loss"""
        pass
```

**Key Points:**
1. Extends SpeechBrain's base Brain class
2. Override required for Flower federation to track processed samples
3. Core methods remain similar to standard SpeechBrain implementation
4. `fit()` method modified to return:
   - Number of processed samples
   - Average training loss
   - Average Word Error Rate (WER)

**Important Note:**
- The implementation closely follows SpeechBrain's standard pattern
- Main modification is in the `fit()` method to support federated learning metrics

This class serves as the foundation for implementing federated ASR training with Flower integration.

Here's the condensed version of the training loop implementation focusing on key details:

# Training Loop Implementation

## Key Components

### Fit Method Overview
```python
def fit(self, epoch_counter, train_set, valid_set=None, progressbar=None, 
        train_loader_kwargs={}, valid_loader_kwargs={}):
```

### Critical Implementation Details

1. **Data Loading Setup**
```python
# Convert datasets to DataLoader if needed
if not isinstance(train_set, (DataLoader, LoopedLoader)):
    train_set = self.make_dataloader(
        train_set, 
        stage=sb.Stage.TRAIN, 
        **train_loader_kwargs
    )
```

2. **Training Loop Structure**
```python
for epoch in epoch_counter:
    # Training phase
    self.on_stage_start(sb.Stage.TRAIN, epoch)
    self.modules.train()
    
    for batch in tqdm(train_set, initial=self.step, dynamic_ncols=True):
        self.step += 1
        loss, wer = self.fit_batch(batch)
        self.avg_train_loss = self.update_average(loss, self.avg_train_loss)
```

3. **Validation Loop**
```python
if valid_set is not None:
    self.modules.eval()
    with torch.no_grad():
        for batch in tqdm(valid_set):
            loss = self.evaluate_batch(batch, stage=sb.Stage.VALID)
            avg_valid_loss = self.update_average(loss, avg_valid_loss)
```

## Important Features

- **Checkpoint Management**: Supports intra-epoch checkpointing based on time intervals
- **Progress Tracking**: Uses tqdm for progress visualization
- **Distributed Training**: Supports distributed training with sampler epoch updates
- **Debug Mode**: Includes debug options to limit batches and epochs

## Best Practices

1. Reset nonfinite count at each epoch start
2. Proper handling of train/eval modes
3. Gradient handling with `torch.no_grad()` during validation
4. Progress bar management for distributed training

## Key Parameters

- `epoch_counter`: Controls training duration
- `train_set/valid_set`: Training and validation datasets
- `progressbar`: Toggle progress visualization
- `train_loader_kwargs/valid_loader_kwargs`: DataLoader configurations

## Return Values
Returns tuple of:
- Total batch count
- Final average training loss
- Final validation WER (if validation performed)

# Federated Speech Model Training via Flower and SpeechBrain

## Key Components & Setup

### Prerequisites
- GPU recommended
- Familiarity with SpeechBrain and Flower frameworks
- Uses ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition) as example task
- Demo uses small dataset (100 recordings)

### Key Features
1. Pre-loaded centralized initial model
2. Three aggregation strategies:
   - Standard FedAvg
   - Loss-based
   - WER-based aggregation
3. Additional server-side training with held-out dataset

### Installation
```python
# Install SpeechBrain
!python -m pip install git+https://github.com/speechbrain/speechbrain.git@develop

# Install Flower
!pip install flwr
!pip install tqdm==4.50.2
```

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Data Preparation
- Create TSV format data manifest files
- Files contain speech data locations and text annotations
- Template dataset provided for simulation

### 2. Server & Client Configuration
```bash
# Server configuration (server.sh)
python3 server.py \
  --data_path="/content/Flower-SpeechBrain/temp_dataset/" \
  --config_path="/content/Flower-SpeechBrain/configs/" \
  --tr_path="temp_dataset.tsv" \
  --config_file="template.yaml" \
  --min_fit_clients=1 \
  --rounds=1 \
  --local_epochs=1 \
  --server_address="localhost:24338"

# Client configuration (clients.sh)
python3 client.py \
  --cid=$i \
  --data_path="/content/Flower-SpeechBrain/temp_dataset/" \
  --config_path="/content/Flower-SpeechBrain/configs/" \
  --config_file="template.yaml" \
  --eval_device="cuda:0" \
  --server_address="localhost:24338"
```

### 3. Integration Steps
1. Define Brain class (SpeechBrain)
2. Initialize Brain class and dataset
3. Define SpeechBrain Client (Flower client)
4. Define Flower Strategy (server-side)

### Best Practices
- Use GPU for faster processing
- Ensure proper data partitioning in production
- Allow sufficient initialization time between server and client startup
- Real applications require significantly more training data (100+ hours)

Here's the condensed version focusing on key implementation details:

# Model and Dataset Initialization

## Key Implementation Details

The `int_model` function handles model and dataset initialization for federated learning:

```python
def int_model(flower_path, tr_path, dev_path, test_path, save_path, data_path, 
              config_file="CRDNN.yaml", tokenizer_path=None, eval_device="cuda:0",
              evaluate=False, add_train=False):
    # Load hyperparameters with overrides
    params_file = flower_path + config_file
    
    # Configure overrides based on mode
    overrides = {
        "output_folder": save_path,
        "number_of_epochs": 1 if evaluate else None,
        "test_batch_size": 4 if evaluate else None,
        "device": eval_device if evaluate else None,
        "lr": 0.01 if add_train else None
    }

    # Load and update parameters
    with open(params_file) as fin:
        params = load_hyperpyyaml(fin, overrides)
    
    # Set data paths
    params.update({
        "data_folder": data_path,
        "train_tsv_file": tr_path,
        "dev_tsv_file": dev_path,
        "test_tsv_file": test_path,
        "save_folder": f"{params['output_folder']}/save",
    })
```

## Critical Components

1. **Dataset Preparation**:
   - Uses CommonVoice dataset preparation
   - Creates experiment directory
   - Runs preparation on main process only using `run_on_main`

2. **Tokenizer Setup**:
```python
tokenizer = SentencePiece(
    model_dir=params["save_folder"],
    vocab_size=params["output_neurons"],
    annotation_train=params["train_csv"],
    annotation_read="wrd",
    model_type=params["token_type"],
    character_coverage=params["character_coverage"],
)
```

3. **Model Initialization**:
```python
asr_brain = ASR(
    modules=params["modules"],
    hparams=params,
    run_opts=run_opts,
    opt_class=params["opt_class"],
    checkpointer=params["checkpointer"],
)
asr_brain.tokenizer = tokenizer
```

## Best Practices

- Parameters can be overridden via YAML file or through function arguments
- Different configurations for evaluation and training modes
- Tokenizer is attached to the ASR brain instance
- Dataset preparation is handled on the main process only to avoid conflicts

The function returns both the initialized ASR brain and dataset: `return asr_brain, [train_data, valid_data, test_data]`

# SpeechBrain Federated Learning Client Implementation

## Core Weight Management Functions

```python
def set_weights(weights, modules, device) -> None:
    """Set model weights from NumPy ndarrays to PyTorch modules"""
    state_dict = OrderedDict()
    valid_keys = [k for k in modules.state_dict().keys()]
    for k, v in zip(valid_keys, weights):
        state_dict[k] = torch.Tensor(np.array(v)).to(device)
    modules.load_state_dict(state_dict, strict=False)

def get_weights(modules):
    """Extract model weights as NumPy ndarrays"""
    return [v.cpu().numpy() for k, v in modules.state_dict().items()]
```
