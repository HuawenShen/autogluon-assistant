# Condensed: <!-- This cell is automatically updated by tools/tutorial-cell-updater.py -->

Summary: This tutorial demonstrates the implementation of SpeechBrain's speech processing capabilities, focusing on practical code examples for various audio tasks. It provides implementation patterns for automatic speech recognition (ASR) with multi-language support, speech separation, speech enhancement, speaker verification, and text-to-speech synthesis using pre-trained models. The tutorial helps with tasks like loading pre-trained models, processing audio files, and generating speech from text. Key features covered include multi-language ASR support, separation of multiple speakers, speech enhancement, speaker verification scoring, and text-to-speech generation using Tacotron2 with HIFIGAN vocoder, all accessible through HuggingFace-hosted models.

*This is a condensed version that preserves essential implementation details and context.*

Here's the condensed tutorial focusing on essential implementation details and key concepts:

# SpeechBrain Quick Start Guide

## Installation
```bash
# Install SpeechBrain
pip install git+https://github.com/speechbrain/speechbrain.git@develop
```

## Key Features and Usage

### Basic Model Training
```bash
cd recipe/dataset_name/task_name
python train.py train.yaml --data_folder=/path/to/the/dataset
```

### Speech Recognition

#### Multi-language ASR Support
```python
from speechbrain.inference.ASR import EncoderDecoderASR

# English ASR
asr_model = EncoderDecoderASR.from_hparams(
    source="speechbrain/asr-crdnn-rnnlm-librispeech",
    savedir="pretrained_models/asr-crdnn-rnnlm-librispeech"
)

# For languages with special requirements (e.g., Mandarin)
from speechbrain.inference.interfaces import foreign_class
asr_model = foreign_class(
    source="speechbrain/asr-wav2vec2-ctc-aishell",
    pymodule_file="custom_interface.py",
    classname="CustomEncoderDecoderASR"
)
```

### Speech Separation
```python
from speechbrain.inference.separation import SepformerSeparation

model = SepformerSeparation.from_hparams(
    source="speechbrain/sepformer-wsj02mix",
    savedir='pretrained_models/sepformer-wsj02mix'
)
est_sources = model.separate_file(path='audio.wav')
```

### Speech Enhancement
```python
from speechbrain.inference.separation import SepformerSeparation

model = SepformerSeparation.from_hparams(
    source="speechbrain/sepformer-whamr-enhancement",
    savedir='pretrained_models/sepformer-whamr-enhancement4'
)
enhanced_speech = model.separate_file(path='audio.wav')
```

### Speaker Verification
```python
from speechbrain.inference.speaker import SpeakerRecognition

verification = SpeakerRecognition.from_hparams(
    source="speechbrain/spkrec-ecapa-voxceleb",
    savedir="pretrained_models/spkrec-ecapa-voxceleb"
)
score, prediction = verification.verify_files("file1.wav", "file2.wav")
```

### Text-to-Speech
```python
from speechbrain.inference.TTS import Tacotron2
from speechbrain.inference.vocoders import HIFIGAN

# Initialize models
tacotron2 = Tacotron2.from_hparams(
    source="speechbrain/tts-tacotron2-ljspeech",
    savedir="tmpdir_tts"
)
hifi_gan = HIFIGAN.from_hparams(
    source="speechbrain/tts-hifigan-ljspeech",
    savedir="tmpdir_vocoder"
)

# Generate speech
mel_output, mel_length, alignment = tacotron2.encode_text("Your text here")
waveforms = hifi_gan.decode_batch(mel_output)
```

## Important Notes
- All pre-trained models are available on HuggingFace
- Supports multiple languages for ASR: English, French, Italian, Mandarin, Kinyarwanda
- Speech separation supports up to 3 speakers
- Models handle various audio formats (wav, mp3, flac)
- Sample rate requirements vary by model (8kHz, 16kHz, 22.05kHz, 44.1kHz)
