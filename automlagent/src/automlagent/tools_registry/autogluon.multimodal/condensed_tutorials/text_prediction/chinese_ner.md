# Condensed: AutoMM for Named Entity Recognition in Chinese - Quick Start

Summary: This tutorial demonstrates implementing Named Entity Recognition (NER) for Chinese text using AutoGluon's MultiModalPredictor. It covers essential techniques for loading preprocessed datasets, configuring and training NER models with Chinese pretrained transformers (specifically 'hfl/chinese-lert-small'), and performing predictions with visualization. The tutorial helps with tasks like setting up NER pipelines, model training configuration, and entity prediction/visualization. Key features include custom entity label support (brand, product, pattern, misc), evaluation methods, and visualization utilities, making it valuable for both Chinese and English NER implementations with minimal workflow adjustments.

*This is a condensed version that preserves essential implementation details and context.*

Here's the condensed tutorial focusing on essential implementation details:

# AutoMM for Chinese Named Entity Recognition - Quick Start

## Key Implementation Details

### Setup and Data Loading
```python
!pip install autogluon.multimodal

from autogluon.multimodal import MultiModalPredictor
from autogluon.core.utils.loaders import load_pd
from autogluon.multimodal.utils import visualize_ner

# Load preprocessed datasets
train_data = load_pd.load('https://automl-mm-bench.s3.amazonaws.com/ner/taobao-ner/chinese_ner_train.csv')
dev_data = load_pd.load('https://automl-mm-bench.s3.amazonaws.com/ner/taobao-ner/chinese_ner_dev.csv')
```

### Model Training
```python
# Critical configurations
label_col = "entity_annotations"
model_path = f"./tmp/{uuid.uuid4().hex}-automm_ner"

# Initialize predictor
predictor = MultiModalPredictor(
    problem_type="ner", 
    label=label_col, 
    path=model_path
)

# Train model
predictor.fit(
    train_data=train_data,
    hyperparameters={
        'model.ner_text.checkpoint_name':'hfl/chinese-lert-small'  # Chinese pretrained model
    },
    time_limit=300  # 5 minutes training limit
)
```

### Evaluation and Prediction
```python
# Evaluate model
predictor.evaluate(dev_data)

# Make predictions
predictions = predictor.predict({'text_snippet': [text]})

# Visualize results
visualize_ner(text, predictions[0])
```

## Important Notes

1. **Model Selection**: Use Chinese or multilingual pretrained models for Chinese text (e.g., 'hfl/chinese-lert-small')
2. **Entity Labels**:
   - HPPX: brand
   - HCCX: product
   - XH: pattern
   - MISC: miscellaneous information

## Best Practices

1. Ensure data is properly preprocessed before training
2. Adjust time_limit based on dataset size and requirements
3. Use visualize_ner() to verify predictions
4. Store model_path in a persistent location for reuse

The implementation supports both Chinese and English NER with the same workflow - only the pretrained model selection needs to be adjusted accordingly.
