autogluon.tabular

This task is clearly a classification problem with tabular data, making AutoGluon Tabular the ideal choice for several reasons:  1. Data Structure: The datasets (train.pq and inference.pq) contain structured tabular data with multiple features about Airbnb listings. While there are text fields (name, description, etc.), the overall dataset structure is tabular with categorical and numerical features.  2. Task Type: We need to predict a price category (price_label) which represents binned price ranges - this is a classic classification task on tabular data, which is precisely what AutoGluon Tabular is optimized for.  3. Tool Specialization: AutoGluon Tabular is specifically designed to handle tabular data efficiently, automatically handling preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, and ensembling for classification tasks.  4. Alternatives Comparison: - AutoGluon Multimodal: While it could handle the text fields, it's explicitly noted that it "does not work the best with pure tabular data" - AutoGluon Timeseries: Not appropriate as this isn't a time series forecasting problem - FlagEmbedding: Focused on retrieval tasks, not classification - General ML/DL: Too generic when we have a specialized tool available  AutoGluon Tabular will automatically handle the categorical encoding, missing values, feature selection, and model training with minimal code required, making it the most efficient choice for this price category prediction task.
